## **Executive Summary:**

This comprehensive report examined the diversity and educational trends across six major universities in Washington and focused on datasets related to STEM and non-STEM degrees, race/ethnicity distribution, and the historical patterns within these variables. Utilizing reliable and publicly available datasets, the study honed in on specific variables to analyze undergraduate and graduate experiences within the selected universities. The findings revealed a consistent pattern of increasing STEM degrees, contrasting with the more fluctuating and occasionally declining trends in non-STEM degrees. Notably, this report highlights a positive shift in diversity, especially in undergraduate STEM degrees.

While this positive trend is certainly motivating, it is also important to recognize still-present issues in the lack of ideal diversity, in particular in those universities where there is still a stark gap between White students and racial minorities. A key takeaway is the crucial role of promoting diversity in education, as demonstrated by the data's provision of the ability to hold educational institutions accountable for potential disparities across STEM and non-STEM majors. The report emphasizes the importance of addressing existing gaps in diversity progress and calls for reexamining how these institutions welcome and promote diversity, particularly for minority groups. By shedding light on the stark racial landscape, especially the dominance of White students, the report serves as a tool to encourage further discourse and action, pushing educational institutions to revisit their diversity distribution strategies.

As such, the primary audience of this report is the leaders of Washington's higher education institutions, for their roles in influencing the diverse landscape of the student populations within Washington's colleges. Towards a more general audience, this report can also prove helpful in educating current and new generations of university students regarding the diverse makeup of their educational environments.
